# watsonBowl

Watson Bowl is a private sports prediction game between my family that I started over 10 years ago. Since its conception in 2010 it has received many upgrades to reflect my abilities at the time. Originally it was set up on Microsoft Excel, requiring manual input and VBA, before being updated onto 'Google Sheets' using forms, email and javascript. Since then it has been upgraded twice, first onto its own website and then again into my first Progressive Web App (PWA). The finished product using a combination of Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, MySQL and CRONS to provide results in real time. As a PWA users can download onto their smartphones and fufil all functionality. I am currently working on pushing notifcations and updates to enhance the experience. This is a demo verison of the Live Watson Bowl and therefore some functions have been disabled (commented out) or removed.
